It is in the nature of police repo rt (challan ) submitted by the police under the Criminal Procedure Code and has all the trappings of such a police report and the Trial Court shall proceed upon it accordingly. 8. It follows that the High Court may have been technically correct in holding that the case could not have been registered in the form of First Information Report . However, setting aside of the registration of the case in that format did not amount to quashment of the criminal proceedings against the respondents. The initiation of criminal proceedings, its investigation and trial is to be conducted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Section 13 of the Act. The very recording of the information under C. A. No.09 of 2006 11 Section 13(10) of the Act in the register of arrest and detention, mentioni ng the names of the persons arrested , giving details of the information regarding the crime itself amounts to registration of a criminal case on the basis of which the complaint can be filed before the Special Court in the nature of police report under Section 173 of Criminal Procedure Code.

A suit for specific performance was filed by the petitioners who alleged that they ha d entered into an agreement to sell dated 30 April 2009 with the respond ents for the sale of certain lands . The petitioners were required to lead evidence in support of their claim which they failed to do despite being granted a number of opportunities; resultantly their side was closed and the learned Judge of the Trial Court dismiss ed their suit. The petitioners challenged the decision by filing an appeal , which was dismissed and so too the revision filed by them before the High Court . Therefore , it is against three concurrent judgments that the instant petition has been file d. 2. The learned counsel says that the petitioners were not given sufficient opportunity to lead evidence before closing their side and dismiss ing their suit . The learned counsel has referred to the order sheet s of the Trial Court, which have been filed through CMA No. 1473/2020 . 3. The Trial Court‚Äôs order dated 3 October 2012 refers to an application of the petitioners whereby they sought the Court‚Äôs permission to prove the ‚ÄòIqrar Nama , [agreement] through CP 1975/2019 2 secondary evidence ‚Äô because its original was stated to be with the defendants (respondents herein) . We asked the learned counsel to refer to the second ary evidence sought to be produced , that is the copy of the said Iqrar Nama , however, the learned counsel state s that the same was not an Iqrar Nama but a decision dated 30 April 2009. 4. The petitioners had relied on an Iqrar Nama (agreement) but later stated that the document was instead a decision . Leaving aside the question whether they could change their stance so fundamentally , we have examined the referred to document which is a ‚Äòdecision‚Äô issued by the ‚ÄúEmarat -e-Islami Taliban , Waziristan wa Afghanistan ‚Äù (‚ÄòTaliban ‚Äô). The Taliban had no legal authority to decide cases . The Taliban infiltrated into Pakistan and by mid - 2005 had illegally occup ied and assume d control over a part of the territory of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan , including parts of Waziristan . Pakistan is a sovereign country and the applicable law of Pakistan applies over every inch of its territory . Every square inch o f the territor y of Pakistan is pre cious and must be kept free and safe. 5. The physical possession of any part of the territory of Pakistan taken over by the Taliban contravened the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan ( ‚ÄòConstitution ‚Äô) and any decision given by the Taliban would be unconstitutional, unlawful and of no legal effect. Subverting the Constitution and subjugating the people does not confer legitimacy on an aggressor nor renders an aggressor‚Äôs decisions constitutionally legitimate. The learned counsel‚Äôs attempt to alternative ly categorise the purported ‚Äòdecision‚Äô as an agreement is also not permissible because it undermine s the sovereignty of Pakistan . The purported agreement is ‚Äòforbidden‚Äô, ‚Äòunlawful‚Äô and opposed to ‚Äòpublic policy‚Äô in terms of section 23 of Contract Act, 1872 , therefore , it is of no legal effect. 6. The learned Judge of the Trial Court ha d provided a number of opportunities to the petitioners to lead evidence but they had repeatedly failed to do so and failed to establish the su bsistence of an agreement between them selves and the respondents . We have also considered the submission that if the petitioner s were CP 1975/2019 3 permitted to produce the ‚Äòdecision‚Äô / ‚Äòagreement‚Äô, they would have succeeded.'),\n",

For the Respondent : Mr. Tariq Javed Qureshi , ASC Mir Aurangzeb , AOR (Absent). Date of Hearing: 10 March 2021. ORDER Qazi Faez Isa, J . We had issued notice to the respondent , subject to limitation , since the petition was filed after fifty-four days of the prescribed period . Through CMA No. 6838 of 2019 , the delay is sought to be condoned on the ground of illness . In support of the application , outpatient receipts issued by the District City Hospital Lakki Marwat and slips showing medicines prescribed by the said hospital have been attached ; the documents attached with the application are not controverted. Therefore, the delay in f iling the petition is condoned. 2. The respondent had filed a suit seeking specific performance of a document titled ‚ÄòReceipt/Agreement ‚Äô dated 10 March 2007 (exhibit PW 2 /1), hereinafter refe rred to as ‚Äò the said document ‚Äô. The said document is written out on a plain piece of paper and purports to sell-buy land jointl y owned by Inayatullah Khan and his sister , Mst. Taj Bibi , but is purported ly signed by Inayatullah Khan alone . The said document states that an amount of thirty Civil Petition No. 2547/2019 2 thousand rupees has been received by Inayatullah Khan, as part sale consideration of land sold at the rate of nine thousand rupees per kanal , but does not mention the area of the land nor the total sale consideration . It also does not mention the balance sale consideration which is required to be paid. Therefore, f rom the said document , the area of the land which is to be sold -bought cannot be ascertained . The said document is witnessed by Rasheed Ahmed Khan (PW-3) and Yousa f Khan (PW -4). 3. Though t he said document does not mention the area of land sought to be sold -bought nor its description , the learned counsel representing the respondent , states that the description of the land is mentioned in another document (p.142 -143 of the paper book, which does not bear an exhibit number ), hereinafter ‚Äò the page ‚Äô. It is not clear whether the page is an attachment to the said document , or written on its reverse or constitutes a separate document. Inayatullah Khan and the attesting wi tness es have not signed the page. The said document also does not refer to the page . 4. The suit filed by the respondent sought specific performance of the said document and alleged that nine kanals and one marla of land (‚Äòthe said land ‚Äô) was agreed to b e sold-bought and arrayed Inayatullah Khan and his sister , Mst.

Therefore, they have prayed that, ‚Äúthe petitioners may kindly be ordered to be released .‚Äù 2. The petitioners were convicted by the Additional Sessions Judge, Chiniot , under section 302(b) of the Pakistan Penal Code (‚ÄúPPC‚Äù); Mureed Sultan was convicted for the murder of Muhammad Ameer and Nazeer Sultan for the murder of Allah Yar , and both of them were sentenced to death. The Trial Court sent the Murder Reference to the Lahore High Court for confirmation u nder section 374 of the Code whilst the petitioners /convict s preferred an appeal under section 410 of the Code. The High Court maintained their convictions but altered their sentence s from death to imprisonment for life . The petitioners then preferred a criminal petition for leave to appeal before this Court and during the pendency of th is petition a compromise was effected by the petitioners /convict s with the legal heirs of both the deceased and the application mentioned above was submitted . A report was sought from the District and Sessions Judge, Chiniot on August 28, 2017 to verify the legal heirs of the deceased and the genuineness of the compromise. The said Judge has confirmed the genuineness of the compromise and that all the legal heirs have affirme d it. Both the petitioners have remained incarcerated for about eight years and four months, which period excludes the remissions in sentences that they have respectively earned. I therefore agree with my learned brother that the said application Crl. M. A. No. 1379 /2017 2 be accept ed, however, I most respectfully cannot bring myself to agree that the conviction of the convicts/petitioners be ‚Äúset aside‚Äù and they should be ‚Äúacquitted of the charge‚Äù. 3. Section 345 of the Code enables compounding of offences and sets out the methodol ogy thereof. It mentions the offences punishable under the PPC which can be compounded either before or after an accused is convicted. The table contained in subsection (1) of section 345 specifies, ‚Äúpersons by whom offences may be compounded‚Äù. But, s ubsec tion (5) of section 345 stipulates that once an accused has been convicted, ‚Äúno composition for the offence shall be allowed without the leave of the Court before which the appeal is to be heard‚Äù. Undoubtedly, the prescribed offences can be compounded, but the composition of such offences has to be in terms of subsection (6) of section 345 which stipulates that it ‚Äúshall have the effect of an acquittal‚Äù and not that it will be an acquittal or that an acquittal ensues . Subsection (6) of section 345 of the Co de provides: ‚Äú(6) The composition of an offence under this section shall have the effect of an acquittal of the accused with whom the offence has been compounded. ‚Äù 4. In my opinion ‚Äú the effect of an acquittal ‚Äù is different from an acquittal. The guilt of an accused , that is ascertaining whether the accused has committed the offence for which he is charged , is determined by the Trial Court . Once the guilt of the accused has been determined the judgment is delivered by the Court . The judgment has two compon ents, conviction, which means he is guilty, and the sentence, which is the punishment awarded to him . If the legal heirs of the deceased compound the offence it does not mean that the person who was convicted for murder was no t Crl. M. A. No. 1379 /2017 3 guilty of it, which would b e the case if, as a consequence of allowing the composition, he is ‚Äúacquitted‚Äù.'),\n",

(In both cases) Syed Nayab Hassan Gardezi, ASC. Syed Rifaqat Hussain Shah, AOR. For other Respondents: Nemo. (in both cases). Date of Hearing: 18.04.2022. ORDER Qazi Faez Isa, J . Jalal Shah died in the year 1963 leaving behind 114 kanals and 14 marlas of land. He was survived by two sons, namely, Mushtaq Ali Shah and Said Ali Shah, in whose favour inheritance mutation number 71 was approved on 3 December 1965 showing them as the only heirs of Jalal Shah and thus joint owners of his estate. Jalal Shah a lso had a daughter, Mst. Ghulam Fatima, but she had predeceased him on 3 August 1960. Mst. Ghulam Fatima left behind three daughters, namely, Ummat -ul-Aziz, Akhtar Bibi and Safdar Bibi. Ummat -ul-Aziz invoked section 4 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1 961, to claim her share in the estate of Jalal Shah. The said section is reproduced hereunder: ‚Äò4. Succession . In the event of the death of any son or daughter of the propositus before opening of succession, the children of such son or daughter, if any, li ving at the time succession opens, shall per stripes receive a share equivalent Civil Petition No. 3041 of 2018 etc. 2 to the share which such son or daughter, as the case may be, would have received if alive.‚Äô By relying on the aforesaid provision, Ummat -ul-Aziz successfully submitted an app lication to the revenue authorities on 9 February 2008 for the correction of inheritance mutation number 71, but such correction was disallowed in an appeal preferred before the concerned revenue authority. Therefore, on 2 February 2012 she filed a suit se eking cancellation of inheritance mutation number 71 and a declaration that she was entitled to her share in Jalal Shah‚Äôs estate. Ummat -ul-Aziz died on 7 July 2013 and her legal heirs, that is, her husband and son, sought to withdraw the suit filed by her subject to being granted permission to file a fresh suit. Permission was granted, and they filed another suit on 2 June 2014, which was decreed. Appeal against the same was dismissed, and so too the civil revision. It is these three concurrent judgments wh ich have been assailed herein. 2. Mushtaq Ali Shah, son of Jalal Shah, died in the year 1989 and inheritance mutation was made in favour of his legal heirs who sold their share in the land, which had been mutated in their favour, to Misbah -ul- Hassan, a third party. The other son of Jalal S hah, namely, Said Ali Shah, died in the year 1992 and inheritance mutation was made in favour of his legal heirs, who sold their share in the land inherited by them, measuring 46 kanals and 6 marlas , to Syed Kausar Ali Shah, a co -legal heir of Said Ali Sha h. Syed Kausar Ali Shah then sold the said 46 kanals and 6 marlas of land together with the land he had inherited, total measuring 52 kanals and 9¬Ω marlas (‚Äòthe said Land ‚Äô), to Taqi Developers (Pvt) Limited1 through four sale mutations, respectively bearin g numbers 1632, 1633, 1636 and 1643, all of which were sanctioned on 15 November 2007. 3. The contentions of the learned Agha Muhammad Ali Khan, representing the petitioners, were recorded in orders dated 9 November 2021 and 2 December 2021. When the lear ned Mr. Ghulam Nabi, representing the contesting respondents, entered appearance he was told to come prepared on the points noted in the said orders. 1 The petitioner No. 1 in CPLA No.'),\n",

The State and others (2013 SCMR 1281) but we note that in none of the said cases the all -important distinction between cases of Qisas and those of Ta‚Äôzir had come under discussion and the Courts were not properly assisted in those cases in this particular regard. In the case of Ahmad Nawaz @ Gogi (supra ) the Lahore High Court, Lahore had observed on the issue as follows: ‚ÄúAt the very outset, we may here reproduce se ction 305 PPC -- \"305. WALI. ---In case of a qatl, the wali shall be (a) the heirs of the victim, according to his personal law but shall not include the accused or the convict in case of Qatl-e-Amd if committed in the name or on the pretext of honour; and (b) the Government, if there is no heir.\" A bare perusal of the above quoted section clearly states that in case of a qatl, the wali shall be the heirs of the victim, according to his personal law and the said provisions do not contemplate that the h eirs of an heir of the victim shall also be wali of the victim. An heir of a person is understood to be a person who is entitled to inherit the property of the deceased at the time of his death. In the case in hand the inheritance of the victim automatical ly opened upon his death and at that time, the only heirs of the victim were his father and mother and thus the Criminal Appeal No. 137 -L of 2010 17 property of the deceased automatically devolved upon the said heirs of the victim. After devolving of the property of the victim upon the said h eirs the inheritance of the victim had been exhausted and there was nothing left for anybody else to inherit from the victim. Keeping in view the spirit of the provisions of section 305(a) PPC the heirs of a victim are surely different from the heirs of a wali of the victim. In the present case, the consanguine sisters were to inherit from the father of the victim namely Maqbool Ahmad and not from Mohsin Raza victim himself and thus they were the heirs of Maqbool Ahmad not of the victim namely Mohsin Raza. It is not disputed that the said consanguine sisters had not and could not inherit the property of Mohsin Raza as they were not his heirs at the time of his murder. What the consanguine sisters are claiming before us is a right to effect or refuse a compro mise with the appellant which right they claim to have inherited from Mohsin Raza\\'s father namely Maqbool Ahmad and they are not claiming any right to inherit the property of Mohsin Raza directly. According to the spirit and rationale of the provisions of section 305(a), P.P.C. a wali of the victim is the person who is entitled to inherit the property of the victim and the interpretation of the said provisions cannot be stretched to include in the definition of wali a person who claims to have inherited the right of compromise possessed by the Wali. No legal provision has been produced nor any reference to the Islamic Jurisprudence has been made before us to support such a stretched interpretation of the provisions of section 305(a), P.P.C.')]"

As noted in the history of the contempt law in the beginning of the judgment, a similar provision was enacted in the COCA 1976 by way of an amendment when the then Prime Minister was facing the contempt proceedings. Howeve r, subsequently, when the aforesaid law was repealed, the aforesaid provision of appeal was not re -enacted in the new law of contempt. Const. P. No. 77 of 2012 90 Such a provision, it appears, was drafted to meet a particular situation then prevailing. Incidentally, a similar situati on had arisen in the recent past where the sitting Prime Minister faced contempt of Court charge who was ultimately convicted for it and disqualified from being a member of the Parliament as also the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister elected thereafter is sailing in the same boat and is before the Court to answer the charge of contempt of Court for non -compliance with the order passed in Dr. Mobashir Hassan‚Äôs case . In this backdrop, the impugned COCA 2012 was promulgated, section 11(3) whereof, inter alia, provided for the right of appeal as discussed hereinabove. 81. Mr. Latif Afridi, ASC has referred to the case titled as In the matter of: Special Reference by the President Under Article 143 (AIR 1965 SC 745) wherein the President of India sent a Specia l Reference under Article 143(1) of the Constitution to the Indian Supreme Court for its opinion on five questions. The background of the Reference was that on 14.03.1964, the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Uttar Pradesh administered, in the name o f and under the orders of the Legislative Assembly, a reprimand to one Keshav Singh for having committed contempt of the House and also for having committed a breach of the privileges of Narsingh Narain Pandey, a member of the House by getting printed and published a pamphlet which bore the signature of Keshav Singh along with the signature of other persons. In pursuance of the decision taken by the House later on the same day, the Speaker directed that Keshav Singh be committed to prison for committing ano ther contempt of the House by his conduct in the House when he was summoned to receive the aforesaid reprimand and for writing a disrespectful letter to the Speaker of the House earlier. According to this order, a warrant was Const. P. No. 77 of 2012 91 issued under the signature of the Speaker of the House directing that Keshav Singh be detained in Jail for a period of seven days, and in execution of the warrant , Keshav Singh was detained in Jail. On 19.03.1964, Mr. B. Solomon Advocate presented a petition to the High Court on behalf on Keshav Singh under section 491 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, as well as under Article 226 of the Constitution. The matter was fixed before N.U. Beg and G.D. Sahgal JJ., when the petition was admitted and notice was ordered to be issued to th e respondents. It was further ordered that the applicant should be released on bail. The Deputy Registrar of the Court was asked to take necessary action in connection with the Order. On 21.03.1964 , the House proceeded to take action against the two Judges who passed the order on Keshav Singh ‚Äôs application, as well as Keshav Singh and his Advocate. The House by its resolution dated 21.03.1964 took the view that M/ S G.D. Sahgal, N.U.'),\n",

According to Section 221(5), Cr.P.C. the fact that the Charge is made in the terms noted above ‚Äúis equivalent to a statement that every legal condition required by law to constitute the offence charged was fulfilled in the particular case‚Äù . At this stage, reference may be made to the contents of the short order dated 26 April, 2012 passed by the 7 -memebr bench, which reads as under: - ‚ÄúFor the reasons to be recorded later the accused S yed Yousaf Raza Gillani, Prime Minister of Pakistan/Chief Executive of the Federation, is found guilty of and convicted for contempt of court under Article 204(2) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 read with section 3 of the Cont empt of Court Ordinance (Ordinance V of 2003) for willful flouting, disregard and disobedience of this Court‚Äôs direction Cr.O.P. No.06 of 2012 contained in paragraph No. 178 of the judgment delivered in the case of Dr. Mobashir Hassan v Federation of Pakis tan (PLD 2010 SC 265) after our satisfaction that the contempt committed by him is substantially detrimental to the administration of justice and tends to bring this Court and the judiciary of this country into ridicule. 2. As regards the sentence to be p assed against the convict we note that the findings and the conviction for contempt of court recorded above are likely to entail some serious consequences in terms of Article 63(1)(g) of the Constitution which may be treated as mitigating factors towards t he sentence to be passed against him. He is, therefore, punished under section 5 of the Contempt of Court Ordinance (Ordinance V of 2003) with imprisonment till the rising of the Court today.‚Äù CONST. P. 40/2012 etc. 38 Para 2 of the above order clearly refers to the disqualifica tion envisaged by Paragraph (g) of Clause (1) of Article 63, and not to the disqualification mentioned in Paragraph (h) . 31. Mr. Muhammad Munir Piracha, learned ASC for the Federation argued that the jurisdiction of this Court is barred under Article 69(1) of the Constitution because the Speaker is the Member of Parliament, therefore, her ruling dated 25 May, 2012 falls within the ambit of internal proceedings and the Court has no jurisdiction to interfere with the same. He has also taken an alternate plea that in case the Court comes to the conclusion that the petition is competent and the ruling of the Speaker is held to be invalid, in that eventuality, the ruling of the Speaker may not be substituted with the Court‚Äôs verdict, rather the matter should be remitted to the Speaker to decide it afresh and the bar of 30 days will not apply. On this issue, the learned Attorney General argued that this Court has no role to play in the matter of disqualification of a member of the Parliament, which is to be de cided either by the Speaker of the National Assembly or eventually by the Election Commission and that the Speaker of the National Assembly is not bound by the judgment of the Supreme Court. 32. Mr. Aitzaz Ahsan learned Sr. ASC was called upon to prese nt his argument on whether this Court is empowered to examine the validity of a ruling by the Speaker of the Assembly under Article 63(2) of the Constitution. He stated that the Constitution itself has specifically empowered the Speaker to decide the quest ion of disqualification of a member of the Parliament, therefore, the decision of the Speaker is sui generis and adjudicatory in nature. According to CONST. P. 40/2012 etc. 39 the learned counsel, Speaker‚Äôs ruling is pre -eminently within the ambit of the judgment of the 7 -member be nch of this Court, which only hinted to a possible disqualification of the respondent pursuant to the conviction, and did not contemplate it conclusively.'),\n",

He submitted requi site report and also filed a reply to the notice and sought time to further probe into the matter, as desired by th is Court. The learned Bench of this Court on having taking into consideration his reply, concluded that he had committed contempt of Court and had also interfered in the proceedings of administration of justice, for which no sincere regrets or unconditional apology had been tendered by him, therefore, on the basis of such findings, he was held guilty of contempt of Court and was accordingly punished and awarded sentence. With this background, ICA was filed and this Court formulated a question Cr.O.P.15 of 2002 -17- ‚Äúwhether the conduct of the appellant, if considered with the attending circumstances and the facts established on record, did constitute an act of contempt of Court, as envisaged under Article 204 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the provisions of Contempt of Court Act, 1976? and the answer was as follows:--- ‚ÄúWe may observe here at the very outset that a distinction has to be made between a case of contempt of Court based on defiance or violation of a judicial order in the nature of temporary injunction by a party whereby such party was restrained from acting in a particular manner but in spite of service of notice or having come to know of the passing of such order, acts in a manner to alter the position to his advantage so as to frustrate the temporary injunction and an act of mere non-submission of a report called for by the Court by an Officer of the Court. In the former case, the Court would take strict view and mere act of defiance of the judicial order would by itself justify raising of presumption that the doer of the act was guilty of contempt of Court unless he proves otherwise whereas in the latter case, it has to be determined on application of judicial mind as to whether the appellant deliberately did not submit the report on account of having personal interest in any of the parties to cause damage to the other party in the case in which the report was called or had any personal interest which, if proved or established would make the act of non-submission of the report mala fide. In the absence of any of these factors and element of contumacy, his conduct could not be held to have suffered from mala fides or contempt of Court. It has been held in the case of Behawal v. The State PLD 1962 SC 476 that mere non-compliance of an order, in the absence of contumacy, would not amount to contempt of Court.‚Äù 16. From the judgments relied upon by both the sides, inter alia, following principles emanate:--- 1. Orders made by a Court of unlimited jurisdiction in the course of continuous litigation are either regular or i rregular. It is misleading to draw distinction between orders that are Cr.O.P.15 of 2002 -18- ‚Äúvoid‚Äù, in the sense that they can be ignored with impunity by those pe rsons to whom they are addressed, and orders wh ich are ‚Äúvoidable‚Äù in the sense that they may be enforced until set aside, since any order must be obeyed unless and until it is set aside and there are no orders which are void ipso fact o without the need for proceedings to set them aside. [1984 (3) AllER 140 (Issacs v. Roberton)]. 2. If a contravention of an order is to be visited with penalties of a criminal nature that order must be in clear and pr ecise terms, setting out the obligations resting u pon the person affected in clear and unmistakable language.'),\n",

(ii) That the old view, that a Judge in respect of whom contempt proceedings w ere initiated could hear the contempt case himself, in view of the fact that it was a special jurisdiction (sui generis) stands modified by section 8 of the Contempt of Court Act which envisages that a Judge including the Chief Justice should not hear the matter if the contempt relates to his person subject to an exception that if contempt is committed in face of the Court or the Judge or the Chief Justice, he may proceed immediately against the contemner and may punish him. SUBSTANTIVE LAW : (i) That s ince the freedom of speech under Article 66 of the Constitution is subject to the Constitution, as a corollary, it must follow that the freedom of speech of a Member of the Parliament is subject to the contempt law under Article 204 of the Constitution and, therefore, the above privilege is not absolute. (ii) That in view of Article 68 of the Constitution read with clause (c) of sub -rule (2) of Rule 248 of the National Assembly Rules, the Speaker is obliged not to allow a Member to discuss the conduct o f any Judge of the Supreme Court or a High Court in the discharge of his duties and if a Member does it in violation of the above provisions, the Speaker is expected to take any of the actions envisaged under Rules 267, 268 and 269 of the aforesaid Rules discussed hereinabove. (iii) That an expunction order in respect of the offending portion of a speech at the fag -end of the session would not be a defence to an action under Article 204 of the Constitution for the reasons discussed in the body of the ab ove judgment. (iv) That Article 204 of the Constitution relating to the contempt of Court is to be construed in conjunction with Articles 19 and 66 thereof keeping in view the modern trend about contempt law obtaining in the world to protect and projec t the freedom of speech and expression and the freedom of press subject to reasonable restrictions. (v) That the power of contempt should be used sparingly and only in serious cases and that the Court should not be either unduly touchy or over -astute in discovering new varieties of contempt for ‚Äúits usefulness depends on the wisdom and restraint with which it is exercised‚Äù.

(vii) That similarly subject to a prohibition of publication under section 9 of the Contempt of Court Act or under any other law for the time being in force, the publication of fair and substantially accurate reporting of any judicial proceedings is also protected under Exception (iii) to section 3 of the said Act.‚Äù 33. Having considered the dictionary meanings of the word ‚Äòregulate‚Äô and the interpretation given to it by the Superior Courts in the different jud gments noted hereinabove, we reaffirm the law laid down in Khalid Masood‚Äôs case (supra ) that the law referred to in Article 204(3) relates to procedural matters or matters which have not been provided for and though the exercise of the power conferred on a Court by this Article may be regulated by law and subject to law by rules made by the Court, but it does not mean that a statute can control or curtail the power conferred on the Superior Courts under this Article nor in the absence of a statute on the ab ove subject, the said Article will be inoperative. 34.'),\n",

It was further held that the dignity an d authority of the courts has a link with the supremacy and majesty of the law, therefore, any conduct which is calculated to diminish that dignity or authority is a criminal contempt, which a Court is under duty to punish. In State v. M ujibur Rahman Shami (PLD 1973 SC 1), it was observed that contempt of Court is a grave off ence against the State. 68. As rightly argued by Mr. Zafarullah Khan, a Magistrate Class-III is empowered under section 228 PPC to punish a person in such like cases. Similarly, many other authorities are empowered under the Constitution and the law to p unish persons who undermine their authority. In such circumstances, there is no reason as to why a Judge be not empowered to punish a person who may be eroding or undermining his authority. Reference has been made to Lord Denning ‚Äôs book ‚ÄúThe Due Process of Law‚Äù. The learned author, in the introduction to the book, quoted Lord Hardwicke who said in [The St. James ‚Äô Evening Post case (1742) 2 Atkins 469 at p. 472] that t here cannot be anything of greater consequence than to keep the streams of justice clear an d pure, that parties may proceed with safety both to themselves and their characters. There is not one stream of justice. Const. P. No. 77 of 2012 78 There are many streams. Whatever obstructs their courses or muddies the waters of any of those streams is punish able under the single cognomen ‚Äú Contempt of Court ‚Äù. It has its peculiar features. It is a criminal offence but it is not tried on indictment with a jury. It is tried summarily by a judge alone, who may be the very judge who has been injured by the contempt. He further referred to Francis Mann, who wrote in July 1979 issue of The Law Quarterly Review (p. 348) that contempt of Court is undoubtedly one of the great contributions the common law has made to the civilized behaviour of a large part of the world beyond the continent of Europe where the institution is unknown. In his treatise, Lord Denning also referred to the case titled R v. Almon [(1765) Wilm 243 ‚Äì 271] that if the authority of the Judges is to be trampled upon by pamphleteers and news writers, and the people are to be told that the power given to the Judges for their protection is prostituted to their destruction, the Court may retain its power some little time, b ut it will instantly lose all its authority; and the power of the Court will not long survive the authority of it: is it possible to stab that authority more fatally than by charging the Court? 69. In the light of the above discussion , it can safely be concluded that the contempt of Court is a criminal offence, which is tried summarily by a judge alone, who m ay be the very judge who has been injured by the contempt as against a regular trial . The Judge who is being scandalized in special jurisdiction, is not debarred form hearing the case. By providing that no court shall take cognizance of contempt of Court a rising from an averment made in due course in appellate, revisional or review proceedings, till such proceedings have been finalized and no further appeal, revision or review lies, section Const. P. No. 77 of 2012 79 6(3) curtails the power of a Judge, thereby defying the principle o f independence of judiciary, which is not permissible.')],\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Effectiveness:** The RAG approach successfully combines semantic search with language generation, allowing users to retrieve highly relevant case precedents from a large corpus quickly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Precision:** By relying on embeddings and vector similarity, the system prioritizes contextually similar documents, ensuring that summaries and citations correspond closely to the user query.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Transparency:** Each retrieved precedent includes metadata like case title, court, year, and file path, making it easy to verify and cross-reference the source.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Limitations:** The system can only provide answers based on the documents ingested. If a relevant precedent is not present in the dataset, it will indicate that the answer is unavailable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Usefulness:** Legal researchers, students, or professionals can save significant time by using the tool to filter relevant precedents instead of manually reviewing full judgments.  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Room for Improvement:** Expanding the corpus, fine-tuning embeddings for legal terminology, and adding interactive filtering can further improve precision and user experience.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the RAG engine demonstrates a practical application of AI in legal research, combining **accuracy, efficiency, and traceability**."
